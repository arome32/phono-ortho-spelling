What Rebekkah asked for:
    1)  Lysosome is missing the sound :/

    2) Can we adjust the pretest and the assessments so that the participant can't advance until
       the sound is finished playing?

    3) Can the program end with a "Thank you for your time" screen?

    4) The attached pictures need replace the ones that are in there.  I'm scared to do it :)

    5) Participants should be able to use a space in their answer.  Right now, the program won't 
       advance if the participant types a space in the answer field.  This is the case for the 
       pre test and the post test.
    6) Can the answer field on the pre test and post test be longer and the font size bigger?

    7) On the forced selection task--instead of needing to click the word, can there be a button 
       of sorts off to the side?  We want to make sure that the participants know where to click 

    8) Can the output file end up on the desktop when the program closes?
    
    9) I'll also want to change the format of the output file, but we can discuss that on Friday.


What I still need to do (see above):
    1 (is there a sound for this, currently using speaker7 in the active)
    2 (trying to figure it out)
    7 (need to ask what she wants me to change it to, just a bunch of buttons?)
    8 (look into this)
    9 (talk on friday)

Reminder for later:
  go back and figure out how to make the program exit by itself without breakiing anything
  go back and redo the anti repition function you wrote
  




!!!IMPORTANT!!!
   Split the pretest from the overall program
   figure out how to use flask to get the pretest online
   figure out how the training/posttest gets the words that are being used
